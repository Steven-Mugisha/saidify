# SAIDify - (sēdəˌfī)

Generate self-addressing identifiers on arbitrary data.

A self-addressing identifier (SAID) is a kind of content-addressable identifier that uses a two-pass approach to enable
embedding of the identifier in the content itself, thus the name self-addressing rather than content addressing.

A number of different specifications describe SAIDs.

- [ToIP CESR spec section: Self-addressing identifier (SAID)](https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-cesr-specification/#self-addressing-identifier-said) - current
- [ToIP spec (archived) Self-Addressing IDentifier (SAID)](https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-said-specification/draft-ssmith-said.html) - old
